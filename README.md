# DevOps Incident Center

A self-hosted, scalable incident dashboard for tracking real-time alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager. Built for engineering teams to visualize, triage, and resolve service incidents across environments.

---

## ❗ The Problem

Existing incident management tools like PagerDuty are:
- Expensive for small teams ($21+/user/month)
- Over-engineered for simple Prometheus alerting workflows
- Lack customization for specific DevOps toolchains

### 👥 Target Users
- Small to medium engineering teams (2–50 people)
- Teams already using the Prometheus/Grafana stack
- Organizations that want full ownership of their incident data

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Ingests alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager
- Tracks open and resolved incidents with metadata
- Provides a web dashboard to view incidents by service, severity, and status
- Stores historical incident data for audits and reporting
- Exposes incident metrics for Prometheus/Grafana visualization
- Sends notifications to Slack or Teams

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI** — high-performance Python API framework
- **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB** — structured + time-series incident data
- **Celery + Redis** — async job handling
- **SQLAlchemy** — ORM layer
- **Prometheus Exporter** — exposes incident metrics

### Frontend
- **React + Vite**
- **TailwindCSS**

### Infrastructure / DevOps
- **Docker** — containerized dev setup
- **Helm** — Kubernetes packaging
- **Terraform** — infrastructure as code (AKS, storage)
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD pipelines
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
- **Prometheus + Grafana**
- **Alertmanager**
- **Slack Webhooks**

cp .env.example .env
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Or
docker compose up --build
```
